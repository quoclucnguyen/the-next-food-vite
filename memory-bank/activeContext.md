# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Development Areas

- **Cline Memory Bank Setup**: Implementing structured documentation system for better context preservation
- **AI Integration Refinement**: Optimizing Gemini API integration for recipe suggestions and meal planning
- **User Experience Polish**: Improving UI/UX consistency across all features
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Expanding test coverage for core functionality

### Recent Changes

- Added comprehensive Memory Bank documentation structure
- Analyzed existing codebase architecture and component relationships
- Identified key integration points between inventory, recipes, and meal planning
- Documented current technical stack and dependencies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Finish creating all core documentation files
   - Implement .clinerules file with custom instructions
   - Test Memory Bank functionality with Cline
2. **Code Architecture Review**

   - Document component hierarchy and data flow
   - Identify opportunities for code optimization
   - Plan refactoring for better maintainability

3. **Feature Enhancement Planning**
   - Prioritize remaining features based on user value
   - Plan AI integration improvements
   - Design better error handling and loading states

### Medium-term Goals (Next 2-4 Weeks)

1. **Enhanced AI Features**

   - Improve recipe suggestion accuracy
   - Implement smart meal planning algorithms
   - Add nutritional analysis capabilities

2. **User Experience Improvements**

   - Streamline onboarding flow
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add better visual feedback for user actions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize bundle size and loading times
   - Implement better caching strategies
   - Improve offline functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

- **State Management**: Using React Query for server state, considering Zustand for complex client state
- **Component Architecture**: Maintaining shadcn/ui components with custom extensions
- **API Integration**: Centralizing API calls through custom hooks pattern
- **Error Handling**: Implementing consistent error boundaries and user feedback

### Design Patterns in Use

- **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Encapsulating business logic in reusable hooks
- **Compound Components**: Using for complex UI components like forms and dialogs
- **Provider Pattern**: For sharing context across component trees
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction with Supabase

### Current Challenges

1. **AI Response Consistency**: Ensuring reliable and relevant suggestions from Gemini API
2. **Data Synchronization**: Managing real-time updates across multiple users
3. **Mobile Performance**: Optimizing for various device capabilities
4. **Internationalization**: Properly handling Vietnamese text formatting and display

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style Preferences

- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing for better development experience
- **Functional Components**: Using hooks over class components
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Preferring component composition
- **Explicit over Implicit**: Clear naming and explicit type definitions

### UI/UX Patterns

- **Consistent Spacing**: Using Tailwind's spacing scale consistently
- **Accessible Design**: Following WCAG guidelines for accessibility
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Showing information progressively to avoid overwhelm
- **Feedback-Rich Interactions**: Providing clear feedback for all user actions

### Development Workflow

- **Component-First Development**: Building reusable components before features
- **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests alongside feature development
- **Incremental Improvements**: Small, focused commits and pull requests
- **Documentation-Heavy**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights

- Supabase integration works well for authentication and real-time features
- Gemini API provides good recipe suggestions but needs prompt optimization
- shadcn/ui components are highly customizable and maintainable
- React Query simplifies server state management significantly

### User Experience Insights

- Barcode scanning is a key differentiator for inventory entry
- Visual expiration indicators are crucial for food waste prevention
- Meal planning needs to be simple and flexible
- Shopping list generation should be contextual and smart

### Performance Insights

- Image optimization is critical for recipe and food item photos
- Lazy loading improves initial page load times
- Caching strategies are essential for offline functionality
- Bundle splitting helps with code organization and loading

### Development Process Insights

- Regular refactoring prevents technical debt accumulation
- Component documentation improves team collaboration
- Consistent error handling improves user experience
- Automated testing catches regressions early

## Current Technical Debt

- Some components need better TypeScript typing
- Error handling could be more consistent across features
- Loading states need standardization
- Some API calls could be optimized for better performance

## Upcoming Decisions

- Whether to implement push notifications for expiration alerts
- How to handle offline data synchronization conflicts
- Whether to add social features for recipe sharing
- How to implement advanced search and filtering capabilities
